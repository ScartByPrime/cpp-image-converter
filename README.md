# cpp-image-converter
A C++ image converter with support for "inconvenient" formats (BMP, PPM) and the ability to convert to and from JPEG, as well as add functions for rotation, horizontal/vertical image flipping, color inversion, a black-and-white filter, and the Sobel operator.

Solution
Developed BMP and PPM support from scratch.
Integrated and adapted LibJPEG (C) into the C++ codebase.
I implemented all processing operators from scratch.
Build - CMake.

Result
The solution works with the RGBA model, converts efficiently, and allows for all required image manipulations.
Perfect for scaling and integration.
